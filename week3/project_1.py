purpose of serving and engaging diverse audiences by advancing
knowledge about Nigerian art and by offering exhibitions and educational
programs that enable them to learn about art and through art. The museum
has 3 main art collection categories: traditional art, modern art,

the visitors to access images from each category, using the image transformation
methods studied on the collection, following the criteria:
The visitor must have a valid email, must be above 18 years and
the choice of collection category of interest must be specified.
